Project Goal : 
Pre-processing and text feature extraction are essential phases in building classification systems. Given that most text data contains a significant amount of noise, we begin this section with a focus on text cleaning. We will explore two primary techniques for text feature extraction: word embeddings and weighted words. The key procedures involved in this process include:

1. Pre-processing and Text Cleaning
2. Handling Tokenization
3. Managing Stop Words
4. Controlling Capitalization

Each of these steps is critical to properly preparing textual data for classification.

Steps to Run the Code : 
1. Import the Dataset: Begin by importing the dataset from the provided link.
2. Load the Datasets: Load the datasets into the environment.
3. Apply Algorithms: Implement and experiment with various algorithms on the dataset.

Tools, Software, and Libraries : 
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Seaborn
5. Matplotlib
6. Scikit-learn
7. Transformers
8. Torch
9. sklearn.metrics
10. GloVe

Implementation : 
We have implemented several algorithms and also developed a custom algorithm to compare accuracy and determine which method performs best for text classification on the chosen dataset.
